# Telecom Paris - Data Visualization project

Repository of the **group D**.

## Presentation
We built a dashboard to answer the question *Where to invest for a better plastic waste management?*

The data comes from the study *[Future scenarios of global plastic waste generation and disposal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0212-7)*, Laurent Lebreton and Anthony Andrady (2019) for The Ocean Cleanup,

The dashboard is implemented with Plotly.

## Result

The poster presenting the dashboard and our approach is in the *Poster/* folder.
